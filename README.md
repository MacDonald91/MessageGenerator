Project Overview
This is a simple web application designed to provide daily inspiration through random scriptures from the King James Version of the Bible. The project was created as part of the Codecademy curriculum to demonstrate fundamental front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the core structure and content of the web page.

CSS3: Handles all the styling, from the overall layout to the appearance of the button and text.

JavaScript: Powers the main functionality, selecting a random scripture from a predefined list and displaying it on the screen with a button click.

How it Works
The application operates on a simple principle:

A list of inspirational scriptures is stored in an array within the JavaScript file.

When the user clicks the "Generate Scripture" button, a JavaScript function is called.

This function randomly selects one of the scriptures from the array.

The selected scripture is then displayed dynamically on the page.

Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
